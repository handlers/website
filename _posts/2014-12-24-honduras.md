The upshot of having a 3rd grade vocabulary is that burying your head in the dictionary yields whole lot of notable secondary definitions. Who would have thought, for example, that the Spanish word for wife (_esposa_) would turn into [handcuffs](http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=esposas) when pluralized!

The nation of Honduras presents a less hilarious instance of this -- _honduras_ translates to [depths](http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=honduras) (which is a pretty metal name for a country). The name is of uncertain provenance, but [wikipedia says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras#Etymology):

> The name could either refer to the bay of Trujillo as an anchorage, _fondura_ in the Leonese dialect of Spanish, or to Columbus's alleged quote that "Gracias a Dios que hemos salido de esas Honduras" ("Thank God we have departed from those depths").

In the first scenario, it's kind of like Honduras and Anchorage are cousins!

I leave you with a map showing the nation of Honduras, with a pin on Trujillo:
