This blog's title comes from a little song which taught me various irregular forms of the second person imperative in Spanish. It goes something like this (sung to the tune of jingle bells):

> di haz ve  
> di haz ve  
> pon sal se ten ven  
> di haz ve  
> di haz ve  
> pon sal se ten ven  

It seemed pretty appropriate with it being Christmas Eve day and all, y eso es.
