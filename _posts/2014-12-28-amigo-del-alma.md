summary:    A broader definition of 'soulmate'

Sometimes, common turns of phrase translate word for word (_palabra por palabra_). Wikipedia says that this phenomenon is called a [_calque_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calque), so I'll be ill-informedly using that term (full disclosure: I don't know linguistics or anything like that).

These parallel expressions get more fun as they get more figurative -- your boss will put the brakes on a project, while _su jefe pondrÃ¡_ [will put] _freno_ [brake] _al projecto_. Wikipedia mentions "skyscraper" as an example; in Spanish, they are _rascacielos_ (_rascar_: v. to scrape, _cielo_: n. sky). Calques like these are a blast because they bore holes through walls between languages (or vocabularies, at least), and -- for the short span of a synaptic firing -- make you feel like you actually understand Spanish or Chinese or whatever. Foreign languages offer many deeper pleasures, but the calque is instantly gratifying. They're the cotton candy of language learning.

Then there is the curious case of what -- for lack of a better term -- you might call pseudocalques. These phrases employ metaphors that resonate across multiple languages, but aren't word for word matches. They have wrinkles that make you reflect on language a bit.

An example: I [ran across](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0FhbwViHiU) _amigo del alma_  yesterday. This translates literally to "friend of the soul", and [can mean](http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=alma):

> * (friendship) kindred spirit/very close friend  
* (romantic) soulmate

While "soulmate" is commonly used to describe romantic partners in English, I know of no English construction that describes a friendship between people with form-fitted souls, which is a real shame (Spanish also has _hermano de alma_, or "brother of the soul"). In English, you can call someone a "best friend," but that just ranks them among other friends. You can call someone "like a brother," but that's more about loyalty and commitment. "Kindred spirit" is nice, but leaves friendship out of the equation entirely (you'd be sorted into the same bucket as a kindred spirit, but there's no telling whether or not you'd get along in there). The closest thing I can think of is the antiquated "bosom buddy," which is just repulsive.

And then there's the romantic definition! To a non-native speaker at least, _amigo del alma_'s layering of friendly and romantic meanings captures relationships in which your significant other is your best friend. The increasingly popular "partner" gets at this sense a little bit, but certainly introduces businesslike overtones into romantic relationships (which _amigos del alma_ emphatically does not).

I will leave a longer post about why American society is afraid of friend soulmates for another day. For now, here is Roberto Carlos singing "Tu Eres Mi Amigo Del Alma":
