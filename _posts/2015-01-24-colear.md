I first encountered the phrase "wag the dog" in a [movie with that title](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wag_the_Dog). Being like 10 years old at the time, I didn't realize that it was an expression and never stopped to consider what it actually meant (this happens to me a lot). People argue about the term's definition on the Internet, but I think the idea is that some lesser entity is uncharacteristically controlling a larger one. So if an intern is manipulating his/her boss, that would be an instance of a tail wagging the dog.

Now to a Spanish word that implies a tail-wagging entity. _Colear_ is a verb that means _to wag its tail_, and it comes from the noun _cola_, which can translate to _tail_, _line/queue_, and a few more vulgar things. The verb is used more excitingly in the figurative sense: past events can wag their tails, i.e. have lasting repercussions. So, for example, you could say something like "[the Iran-Contra affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair) still wags its tail." _El escándalo Irán-Contra todavía colea_. Amazing, no?

For those keeping score at home: _cola_ (tail) comes from the Latin _cauda_ (tail), which is also where we get the English-by-way-of-Italian _coda_ ([a concluding section of a musical work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_%28music%29)).

Here's a floating dog with a spinning tail:
