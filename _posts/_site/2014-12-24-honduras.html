<p>The upshot of having a 3rd grade vocabulary is that burying your head in the dictionary yields whole lot of notable secondary definitions. Who would have thought, for example, that the Spanish word for wife (<em>esposa</em>) would turn into <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=esposas">handcuffs</a> when pluralized!</p>

<p>The nation of Honduras presents a less hilarious instance of this – <em>honduras</em> translates to <a href="http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=honduras">depths</a> (which is a pretty metal name for a country). The name is of uncertain provenance, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras#Etymology">wikipedia says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The name could either refer to the bay of Trujillo as an anchorage, <em>fondura</em> in the Leonese dialect of Spanish, or to Columbus’s alleged quote that “Gracias a Dios que hemos salido de esas Honduras” (“Thank God we have departed from those depths”).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the first scenario, it’s kind of like Honduras and Anchorage are cousins!</p>

<p>I leave you with a map showing the nation of Honduras, with a pin on Trujillo:</p>
