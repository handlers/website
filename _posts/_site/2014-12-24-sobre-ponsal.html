<p>This blogâ€™s title comes from a little song which taught me various irregular forms of the second person imperative in Spanish. It goes something like this (sung to the tune of jingle bells):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>di haz ve<br />
di haz ve<br />
pon sal se ten ven<br />
di haz ve<br />
di haz ve<br />
pon sal se ten ven  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seemed pretty appropriate with it being Christmas Eve day and all, y eso es.</p>
