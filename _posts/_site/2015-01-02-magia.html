<p><em>Full disclosure: I can only find this passage on Twitter. The account’s purported administrator <a href="https://borgesyyo.wordpress.com/criterio-del-twitter/">writes that</a> he may modify some passages to be fit for Twitter. To a neophyte at least, my inconclusive search for the source text seems appropriately Borgesian.</em></p>

<p>Actively learning a foreign language has destabilized a lot of my gut feelings about language. I can still recall some semiotic gymastics from college, and a few years of news consumption has attuned me to public figures’ expansions and modulations of English words, but nothing illustrates language’s arbitrariness quite like learning that <em>lapiz</em> and <em>pencil</em> actually mean the same thing.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I turn to this tweet from an account that seeks to spread Borges awareness:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Una magia que no estaba en las palabras, sino en lo que las palabras dejaban adivinar, en lo que se traslucía detrás de esas palabras.</p>&mdash; Borges, Jorge Luis (@BorgesJorgeL) <a href="https://twitter.com/BorgesJorgeL/status/441061843076128768">March 5, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A humble attempt at translation (no guarantees on accuracy, here):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A magic that was not within the words themselves, but in that which the words left to be <a href="http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=adivinar">divined</a>, in that which one <a href="http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=traslucirse">surmised</a> behind these words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above translation hinges on two words that I don’t fully understand. The first one is <em>adivinar</em> (which corresponds to ‘divined’ in my translation), a multilayered word that <a href="http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=adivinar">can mean</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>predict the future or discover the hidden, by means of omens or spells</li>
  <li>discover something hidden through conjecture </li>
  <li>correctly solve a puzzle/riddle</li>
  <li>correctly guess something by luck</li>
  <li>distinguish hazily; distinguish from a distance</li>
</ol>

<p>The verb “divine” seems horribly antiquated, perhaps because divination itself seems like an antiquated practice. In contemporary use, I’m fairly sure I have only seen it used to attack or discredit (“and what has he divined from the quarterly stats?”). Nonetheless, it’s the best word I can think of for the job. </p>

<p>The second tough word is <em>traslucir</em>. This one <a href="http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=traslucir">can mean</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Surmise or infer something based on some antecedent or sign</li>
  <li>Said of an object: be translucent</li>
</ol>

<p>In this novice’s judgement, inferances via <em>traslucir</em> seem more scientific than inferences via <em>adivinar</em> (<em>traslucir</em> has <em>antecedents</em>, for Pete’s sake!). Perhaps @BorgesJorgeL used these two terms as complements. The mystical <em>adivinar</em> and more logical <em>traslucir</em> combine to get at the weird, structured haziness of language comprehension.</p>
