<p>I first encountered the phrase “wag the dog” in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wag_the_Dog">movie with that title</a>. Being like 10 years old at the time, I didn’t realize that it was an expression and never stopped to consider what it actually meant (this happens to me a lot). People argue about the term’s definition on the Internet, but I think the idea is that some lesser entity is uncharacteristically controlling a larger one. So if an intern is manipulating his/her boss, that would be an instance of a tail wagging the dog.</p>

<p>Now to a Spanish word that implies a tail-wagging entity. <em>Colear</em> is a verb that means <em>to wag its tail</em>, and it comes from the noun <em>cola</em>, which can translate to <em>tail</em>, <em>line/queue</em>, and a few more vulgar things. The verb is used more excitingly in the figurative sense: past events can wag their tails, i.e. have lasting repercussions. So, for example, you could say something like “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">the Iran-Contra affair</a> still wags its tail.” <em>El escándalo Irán-Contra todavía colea</em>. Amazing, no?</p>

<p>For those keeping score at home: <em>cola</em> (tail) comes from the Latin <em>cauda</em> (tail), which is also where we get the English-by-way-of-Italian <em>coda</em> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_%28music%29">a concluding section of a musical work</a>).</p>

<p>Here’s a floating dog with a spinning tail:</p>
