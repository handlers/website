<p>One of the nice things about listening to songs in different languages is that that nothing seems immediately hackneyed (because it’s hard to understand what the hell is going on). And if you go through the trouble to actually decode the lyrics, there’s a good chance that cheeseball pop’s cliches won’t be as off-putting as they are in your native language — they’ll be hard-won and unfamiliar (as opposed to easily-understood and familiar, as they are in your native language). </p>

<p>For this reason — and probably a few others — I am able to unabashedly enjoy songs like Espinoza Paz’ “<a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Un+Hombre+Normal/3XV2ft?src=5">Un Hombre Normal</a>”, in which Mr. Paz explains to his former significant other that he’s going to pretend to be a functioning member of society after their breakup. Here is a highly unpoetic translation:</p>

<p>(talking)
My love, through this song
I want to tell you how I feel</p>

<p>(singing now)
I know that nothing will happen if you don’t see me tomorrow
I have to accept that you’re not interested in this this romantic anymore</p>

<p>I was never your priority or your center of attention
I have to accept that — if I was ever in your heart — I’m not in there anymore</p>

<p><em>chorus</em>
I’ll pretend to be a normal guy that can live without you; that doesn’t feel horrible.
And I’m going to smile so that my sadness passes unnoticed.</p>

<p>Maturely, I’m going to pull back.
And for the first time I promise not to to cry. 
And I’m going to smile so that my sadness passes unnoticed.</p>

<p>As I said to the city [?] when you vanished,
how can I accept that — if I was ever in your heart — I’m not in there anymore</p>

<p><em>chorus</em></p>

<p>I only wanted you to know how I felt through this song. But that’s it; that’s it.</p>
